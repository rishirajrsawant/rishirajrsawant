I am a Master's Degree holder and a Software Engineer with experience in web and mobile applications. I can build business and enterprise level applications as I have two years of experience as an OpenEdge Developer (Progress 4GL). I love Flutter for mobile app development and React for Web domain. Besides technical, I love dancing, enjoying every little moment of my life and putting it into a video.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web application to be developed in React.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Flutter, Web Development, Progress 4GL, Computer Vision and Python and also Life Philosophy haha :)
